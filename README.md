iTunesWorkflows
===============

This is a few iTunes workflows I've created for Alfred2

There are a few commands in this workflow:

- wp (What's Playing): This will display using Large Type information on the current track.
- initializealbum (Initialize Album): This will set the rating of an entire album to 2 stars.
- genre (Set Genre): This will change the genre of an entire album for the current track to the argument.
- (control-option-up): This will change the rating by 1/2 the delta between current rating and 100.
- (control-option-down): This will change the rating by 1/2 the delta between 0 and current rating.

These commands developed from annoyances I had. If I was working and a track caught my attention, I wanted to look and see what it was without having to stop what I was doing. WP works perfectly for that.

The two rating commands are my equivalent of thumbs up and thumbs down. After years of trying to devise the perfect system, I decided that if a track caught my attention either good or bad, I would indicate that with a thumbs up or thumbs down. The more times I execute it, the smaller the effect of each change. This eliminates my having to decide is it 2 stars or 3 stars or whatever. I simply say I like it or not, and over time, things float to where they should be. 

Enjoy!
